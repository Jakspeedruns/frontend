## Why are the leaderboards and/or websites not loading?

1. Speedrun.com is having technical issues or a large volume of traffic
2. A Jak leadberboard category has been edited on speedrun.com
3. Javascript is disabled in your internet browser (you will see "Loading..." only)
4. Error 522 - Cloudflare is experiencing DNS issues and should be sorted out within the hour.
5. JakSpeedruns is having technical issues or is under construction

## How does the scoring system work?

The scores are calculated using a combination of four main variables: how many runs each category has, how difficult the categories are, how spread out the times are for each category (competitiveness), and how your run compares to the average run.

Points are added for every category that a runner has ran. Ask G3catcher for more details.

## How do I get my stream featured on the site?

If you are a Jak and Daxter speedrunner and want your stream to be featured on the site when you do your runs, just ask Ruh to add you to the list of runners to be featured.

## How does the JakSpeedruns sponsorship program work?

The JakSpeedruns sponsorship program provides stream artwork and promotion for speedrunning events that raise money for charitable organizations.
