## About the Site

The goal of the site is to provide accessibility to content that cannot be found on the Jak and Daxter speedrun.com pages, such as a point system, tools and resources, featured streams of Jak speedrunners, and a community wiki. The site and its team also sponsor many events by providing custom artwork, website promotions, and online branding.

Points are distributed to runners per category based on a series of variables:

- Number of runners in the category
- How good their time is compared to other runners in the category
- Difficulty of the category (category ratings listed below)
- Other miniscule factors


### Difficult Rating:

Each category is assigned a difficulty rating based on how difficult it is to complete a run. Runners will automatically earn a set amount of points for completing a run for each category, with the points increasing with difficulty. Difficulty measured on a scale from 1-4:

Difficulty 1 - 10 points: Very easy to learn/run. Often short extension categories.

Difficulty 2 - 25 points: Easy to learn/run. Includes beginner main categories.

Difficulty 3 - 50 points: Hard to learn/run. May require a difficult trick or a take a long time to complete the run.

Difficulty 4 - 100 points: Reserved for the hardest categories that few runners will accomplish.


### Points Calculation:

Each category is calculated separately from each other. An algorithm determines the number of competitive runs, calculates the average of those runs, and awards points based on how much faster/slower the run is from that average. Non-competitive runs will only receive the base set of points for completing the category. This method is unique to Jakspeedruns, and rewards those that push their times as low as possible, away from the average, and not just awarding points based on rank. This incentivises all runners to continue to immprove their PB, even if their rank would not change. Due to this method, a 10th place runner's point total for a category may change because someone in 90th place improved their PB.


NEW: The maximum number of points per categories of at least difficulty 2 is now 1000 if there are enough runners.

Difficulty 1 - Max = 250 points. 25 runners needed. If less than 25 runners, Max = 10 * total runners

Difficulty 2 - Max = 1000 points. 100 runners needed. If less than 100 runners, Max = 10 * total runners

Difficulty 3 - Max = 1000 points. 25 runners needed. If less than 25 runners, Max = 40 * total runners

Difficulty 4 - Max = 1000 points. 10 runners needed. If less than 10 runners, Max = 100 * total runners

While the WR holder would not gain any more points for PBing, all other runners in the category would lose some points, so their points increase relative to the rest of the runners in that category.

### Category Extensions

Category Extensions are given less points than main category runs:

Difficulty 1 - 5 point boost, Max = 100 points. If less than 25 runners, Max = 5 * total runners

Difficulty 2 - 10 point boost, Max = 500 points. If less than 50 runners, Max = 10 * total runners

Difficulty 3 - 25 points boost, Max = 500 points. If less than 25 runners, Max = 20 * total runners

Difficulty 4 - 50 point boost, Max = 500 points. If less than 10 runners, Max = 50 * total runners

### To Be Determined:

Category Extensions - Jak 3 All Missions Act Runs are not currently being given points due to complexity with the subcategories. We will work to get this fixed.

Individual Levels - How to award points to ILs (especially Jak X)?

OpenGoal - How to award points? Should these boards be kept completely separate from console boards?
